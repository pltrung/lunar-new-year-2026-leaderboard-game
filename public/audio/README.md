# Audio for countdown-zero sequence

Place a short ceremonial drum sound here:

- **Filename:** `ceremonial-drum.mp3`
- **Usage:** Plays once when the countdown hits exactly 0 (only if the tab is visible).
- **Optional:** If the file is missing, the sequence still runs without sound.

You can use any short (1–2 second) drum or gong clip. For a custom URL, set `NEXT_PUBLIC_DRUM_SOUND_URL` in `.env.local`.
